## Introduction

Welcome to the Red Eye Detector project, where cutting-edge computer vision techniques meet road safety. Our mission is to enhance road safety by detecting red eye in drivers, a telltale sign of stress and fatigue. Red eye can impair a driver's ability to operate a vehicle safely, and we're here to change that.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to employ computer vision algorithms to analyze images of drivers' eyes and identify instances of red eye. When red eye is detected, our system steps in, alerting drivers and providing recommendations to reduce stress and fatigue. With this technology, we aim to make roads safer and minimize accidents caused by stressed or fatigued drivers.

## Features

- Cutting-edge computer vision techniques
- Real-time red eye detection
- User-friendly alert system
- Recommendations to reduce stress and fatigue

## Getting Started

To get started with Red Eye Detector, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Red Eye Detector source code file.

Happy coding and safe driving!
